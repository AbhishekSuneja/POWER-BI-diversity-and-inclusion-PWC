# POWER-BI-diversity-and-inclusion-PWC
As my third task was related to create a dashboard for hiring managers and HR Team of Phone Now, providing crucial insights into diversity and inclusion within the organization. The dashboard focuses on key areas such as hiring, promotions, and turnover, capturing essential KPIs that help in evaluating and improving HR practices. By using colorful charts and graphs, the dashboard presents important data in an easily understandable format, empowering the hiring team to make informed decisions and track progress in promoting a diverse and inclusive workplace.

## KPI's:
- **1 Diversity Index:** Track the spectrum of diversity within your organization for ongoing progress monitoring.
- **2 Inclusion Impact:** Measure the tangible effects of inclusion efforts on employee engagement and retention rates.
- **3 Representation Ratios:** Ensure equitable growth opportunities by analyzing demographic balances across different organizational levels.
- **4 Bias Buster:** Use data insights to identify and address unconscious bias, fostering a more inclusive workplace culture.
- **5 Equity Explorer:** Uncover disparities in pay, promotions, and opportunities to drive fairness and equity initiatives.
