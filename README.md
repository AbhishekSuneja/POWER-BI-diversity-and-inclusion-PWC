# POWER-BI-diversity-and-inclusion-PWC
As my third task was related to create a dashboard for hiring managers and HR Team of Phone Now, providing crucial insights into diversity and inclusion within the organization. The dashboard focuses on key areas such as hiring, promotions, and turnover, capturing essential KPIs that help in evaluating and improving HR practices. By using colorful charts and graphs, the dashboard presents important data in an easily understandable format, empowering the hiring team to make informed decisions and track progress in promoting a diverse and inclusive workplace.
